# Encryption

## Encryption in flight (SSL)

- End-to-end encryption: data is encrypted before being sent and decrypted after is received
- Only the sender and the receiver should be able to decrypt/encrypt the messages
- SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)
- Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen
