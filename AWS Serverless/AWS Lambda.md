# AWS Lambda Functions

## Serverless Introduction

- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers do not have to manage servers anymore
- Initially Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service), but now it can mean a lot more
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now the concept also includes anything that is not managed: databases, messaging, storage, etc.
- Serverless does not meant there are no servers, it means that we are not responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure
