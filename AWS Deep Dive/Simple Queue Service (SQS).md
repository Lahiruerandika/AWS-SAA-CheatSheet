## Integration and Messaging

- Deploying multiple applications will inevitable result in the necessity of a communication layer between them
- There are 2 types of integration communication patterns:
    - Synchronous communication
    - Asynchronous communication
- Application decoupling models:
    - SQS: queue model
    - SNS: pub/sub model
    - Kinesis: real-time streaming model
