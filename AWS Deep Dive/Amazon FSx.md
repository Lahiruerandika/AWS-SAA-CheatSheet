# Amazon FSx Overview
- Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
- Fully managed service
  - 1. Amazon FSx for Windows (File Server)
  - 2. Amazon FSx for Lustre
  - 3. Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP
  - 4. Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

## Amazon FSx for Windows
- FSx for Windows is a fully managed Windows file system share drive 
  - Suppor ts SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
  - MicrosoftActiveDirectoryintegration,ACLs,userquotas
  - Can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances
  - Supports Microsoft's Distributed File System (DFS) Namespaces (group files across multiple FS) - Scale up to 10s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
  - Storage Options:
    - SSD – latency sensitive workloads (databases, media processing, data analytics, ...) 
    - HDD – broad spectrum of workloads (home directory, CMS, ...)
  - Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastructure (VPN or Direct Connect) 
  - Can be configured to be Multi-AZ (high availability)
  - Data is backed-up daily to S3

  ## Amazon FSx for Lustre
  - Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing
  - The name Lustre is derived from “Linux” and “cluster
  - Machine Learning, High Performance Computing (HPC)
  - Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation 
  - Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
  - Storage Options:
    - SSD – low-latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small & random file operations 
    - HDD – throughput-intensive workloads, large & sequential file operations
  - Seamless integration with S3
    - Can “read S3” as a file system (through FSx)
    - Can write the output of the computations back to S3 (through FSx)
  - Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct Connect)

  - FSx Lustre - File System Deployment Options
    - Scratch File System
      - Temporary storage
      - Data is not replicated (doesn’t persist if file server fails)
      - High burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
      - Usage: short-term processing, optimize costs 
    - Persistent File System
      - Long-term storage
      - Data is replicated within same AZ
      - Replace failed files within minutes
      - Usage: long-term processing, sensitive data

  ## Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP
  - Managed NetApp ONTAP on AWS
  - File System compatible with NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocol
  - Move workloads running on ONTAP or NAS to AWS
  - Works with: 
    - Linux
    - Windows
    - MacOS
    - VMware Cloud on AWS
    - Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
    - Amazon EC2, ECS and EKS
  - Storage shrinks or grows automatically
  - Snapshots,replication,low-cost,compressionanddata
  - Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)

  ## Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
  - Managed OpenZFS file system on AWS
  - File System compatible with NFS (v3, v4, v4.1, v4.2)
  - Move workloads running on ZFS to AWS
  - Works with: 
    - Linux
    - Windows
    - MacOS
    - VMwareCloudonAWS
    - AmazonWorkspaces&AppStream2.0 
    - AmazonEC2,ECSandEKS
  - Up to 1,000,000 IOPS with < 0.5ms latency
  - Snapshots, compression and low-cost
  - Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)
