# Elastic Beanstalk

- Developers usually don't want to manage infrastructure, they want to deploy code (lol :)
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying applications on AWS
- It uses all the previous components: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc.
- These components can be configured and instantiated via configuration files
- Beanstalk is entirely free, we only pay for the underlying infrastructure
