# AWS Config

- Helps with auditing and recording compliance of AWS resources
- Helps record configurations and changes over time
- Provides the ability of storing the configuration data into S3 where it can be analyzed by Athena
- Problems AWS Config Solves:
    - Check if there is unrestricted SSH access to a security group
    - Check if buckets have public access
    - Find out how did an ALB configuration change over time
- We can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any change
- AWS Config is a per region service, but it can be aggregated across regions and accounts
