# Snowball

- It is a physical data transport solution which helps moving terra bytes or peta bytes of data in our out of AWS
- Alternative to move data over network (in case of huge amount of data)
- It is secure, temper resistant, it uses KMS 256 bit encryption
- It has tracking using SNS and text messages. It has an E-ink shipping label
- Uses pay for data transfer jobs
- Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommissions, disaster recovery
- If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network the data, it probably would be recommended to use a Snowball device
