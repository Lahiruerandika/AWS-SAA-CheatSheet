# CloudFormation

## Infrastructure as Code

- Infrastructure is described with code
- This can be deployed in the cloud in order to create/update/delete the necessary resources

## CloudFormation Introduction

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining AWS infrastructure for any resources
- In the CloudFormation templates we specify the resources needed to be instantiated
- CloudFormation will create those in the right order with exact configuration that we specify
